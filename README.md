As online traffic has grown exponentially over the years, so has the need for protection while using it. Originally, the five founding members of our company came together for one sole purpose: collecting data from the state of the art software known as B.O.S.S. to eventually overthrow it and become the best student accessible software known to man.
	As time went on, we made lots of progress towards reinventing the software we have all grown to love. However, we made a grave mistake. When attacking a power so high and mighty as B.O.S.S, you can expect repercussions if youâ€™re discovered. As our greedy minds were so focused on obtaining the information, we forgot to protect the treasure we had worked so hard to obtain. Thus, our data was stolen by one of the B.O.S.S administrators who caught on to what we were up to. This leads us to the present-day.
	We are NOW the Wifi Wardens. Our team is headed by our CEO Terence Tugwell. The rest of the team consists of our CIO Dylan Weaver, CTO Nathan Granade, CMO Meagan Kropp, and CFO Tristen Barton.  We have come together to create a wireless pentesting device centered around a NodeMCU/Raspberry Pi in order to retake what is rightfully ours. As our budget was wasted when our information was stolen, we need a cheap plan to get it back. A NodeMCU/Raspberry Pi are both inexpensive platforms in which to base our product around, making our wireless pentesting device easily accessible and fit in our current budget.
